To list all the env
conda env list


Use cmd instead of Powershell! I spent 2 hours before I switched to cmd and then it worked!

create Environment:

conda create -n your_environment_name
conda create --name myclone --clone root

see list of conda environments:

conda env list

activate your environment:

activate your_environment_name

conda search â€“f
