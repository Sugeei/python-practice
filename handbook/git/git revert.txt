On the last one we hit a snag:

error: could not apply 3e86ed8... Added Copy Patron button to circ-toolbar
hint: after resolving the conflicts, mark the corrected paths
hint: with 'git add <paths>' or 'git rm <paths>'
hint: and commit the result with 'git commit -c 3e86ed8'

Unfortunately it doesn't tell us what the problems are, so we type:

git status

On branch bug-3475
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 2 commits.
Unmerged paths:
(use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
(use "git add/rm <file>..." as appropriate to mark resolution)
both modified:      koha-tmpl/intranet-tmpl/prog/en/includes/circ-toolbar.inc

Now we can see that circ-toolbar.inc is the file with the conflict. Open the file, look for the standard "<<<<<<< HEAD" marker and edit as necessary. When finished:

git add koha-tmpl/intranet-tmpl/prog/en/includes/circ-toolbar.inc

And then:

git commit -c 3e86ed8
