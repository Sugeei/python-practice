* the solution *
Start by reading http://redis.io/topics/benchmarks

In a nutshell, your python program generates too many roundtrips to Redis on a single connection, so you pay for the network latency at each iteration. My suggestions:

    use pipelining - examples in Python here
    use mget to retrieve several keys in one command
    do more than 8000 iterations, this is too low to assess the performance

Note that you will not reach the performance of redis-benchmark in Python, but you should be able to achieve more than 50K get operations per second with pipelining or mget.
